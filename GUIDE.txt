Directory Structure
--------------------

Here is a short guide about the repository directory structure.

This structure should be replicated inside the macro subfolder named "Prototype",
except for those folders that are not needed (i.e. Audio) and the 3rd parties folder.

Do NOT create a folder without adding some content inside of it: this could mess up
the repository. Create the directories, following the given structure,
only when it is needed.

- 3rd-Parties
- Animations
- Audio
    : Music
    : SFX
- Materials
- Models
- Plugins
- Prefabs
- Resources (Remember, this is a special unity folder, do not use it if you don't know what you are doing)
- Textures
- Sandbox
- _Scenes
    : Levels
    : Other
- Scripts
    : Editor
- Shaders
 
Scene hierarchy structure
--------------------

A brief rule of thumb on how to arrange the objects inside a scene.
It is not mandatory to follow this scheme but consider it as a reference.
ALL empty objects MUST be located at 0, 0, 0 in the world system of reference.

- Management
- GUI
- Cameras
- Lights
- World
    : Terrain
    : Props
- _Dynamic
